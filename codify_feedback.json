Here's a simple example of the coin change algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef coin_change(coins, amount):\n  \"\"\"\n  Returns the minimum number of coins needed to make up the given amount.\n\n  Args:\n    coins: A list of coin denominations.\n    amount: The total amount to make up.\n\n  Returns:\n    The minimum number of coins needed.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # Base case: If the amount is 0, no coins are needed.\n  if amount == 0:\n    return 0\n\n  # Recursive case: Try all possible ways to make up the amount.\n  min_coins = float('inf')\n  for coin in coins:\n    if amount >= coin:\n      num_coins = 1 + coin_change(coins, amount - coin)\n      min_coins = min(min_coins, num_coins)\n\n  return min_coins\n```\n\nThis code defines a function coin_change that takes two parameters: coins (a list of coin denominations) and amount (the total amount to make up). The function returns the minimum number of coins needed to make up the given amount.\n\nThe function uses a recursive approach to try all possible ways to make up the amount. For each coin denomination, the function checks if the amount is greater than or equal to the coin denomination. If it is, the function recursively calls itself to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up the remaining amount.\n\nThe function keeps track of the minimum number of coins needed so far. After trying all possible ways to make up the amount, the function returns the minimum number of coins needed.",
